# CSS Practice Project – Topic Wise (HTML + CSS)

This project contains **HTML structure** and **topic-wise CSS files** for learning and practicing CSS in a clean and organized way.

Each CSS topic is placed in its own folder, and the `index.html` file links all CSS files to show live output in the browser.
